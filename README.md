Hello-world tutorial

Well, this tutorial is pretty good.  I have been wanting to figure out git for awhile now. I am glad I wanted to do this tutorial. Funny most standard tutorials are confusing and you need to go to a third-party site for explanation. Not here.  

Here is my 2nd branch.  I want to go back to master, then back to 2nd.  Merge branches. Delete 2nd branch. Then revert to master branch before 2nd branch merge.
